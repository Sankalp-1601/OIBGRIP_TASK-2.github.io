                    <strong>Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar</strong> was born on 14 April 1891 in Mhow village of Madhya Pradesh. He was the fastest 
                    student in his class since childhood. His mother's name was Bhimabai and father's name was Maloji Sakpal. He was 14 siblings.
                    <br><br>
                    Baba Saheb Ambedkar’s family belonged to Mahar caste, which was considered untouchable.
                    Ambedkar, who has witnessed economic and social discrimination since childhood, started studying in odd circumstances.
                    Due to the prevalence of child marriage, in 1906, he married a nine-year-old girl, Ramabai.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1908, he attended Elphinstone College. He was the first Dalit caste child to get admission in this college.
                    He moved to America in 1913 to do MA. Studying in America was possible due to the monthly stipend from Sahayaji Rao III, the Gaekwad ruler of Baroda. He received his MA degree in 1921 from the London School of Economics.
                    In 1925 Baba Saheb was appointed by the Bombay Presidency Committee to work in the Simon Commission. This commission was opposed all over India.
                    The Ambedkar started extracting fortnightly and weekly papers named ‘Excluded India’, ‘Mook Nayak’, ‘Janata’ to raise voice against the atrocities on Dalits.
                    After India’s independence, he was made Law Minister. On 29 August 1947, he was appointed as the Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee for the constitution of independent India.
                    The Ambedkar resigned from the cabinet in 1951 after his Hindu Code Bill draft was stopped in Parliament. In this draft, gender equality as stated in the laws of succession, marriage and economy.
                    On 14 October 1956, the Ambedkar and his supporters embraced Buddhism while adopting Panchsheel. The Ambedkar believed that Dalits can never get their rights within Hinduism. Ambedkar died on 6 December 1956.
